    api_token:
      type: string
      description: >-
        API tokens are used for authenticating kintone REST API requests sent from external programs.
        Specifying an API token in the "X-Cybozu-API-Token" header of your REST API request authenticates the request, and the API is executed. You can also specify multiple API tokens with commas in between.
